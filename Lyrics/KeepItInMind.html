Keep it in Mind
<BR>
<BR>Out of focus on the edge of your mind
<BR>A little dreamy
<BR>I'm the ghost you don't believe in babe
<BR>You won't see me
<BR>
<BR>Though you think I'm going to now,
<BR>I won't turn and fade away
<BR>
<BR>Chorus
<BR>Just keep it in mind
<BR>I'm not asking when I say
<BR>Just keep it in mind
<BR>The night can bring what may
<BR>to blind and deafen you
<BR>Just keep it in mind
<BR>When you fall asleep at night
<BR>
<BR>2.
<BR>I'm not gonna waste a lot of time 
<BR>waiting for you to come down
<BR>There's a wind from the city
<BR>And I'm gonna be there by sundown.
<BR>
<BR>All the toys you invented, girl
<BR>Are gonna burn and fade away
<BR>
<BR>Chorus
<BR>
