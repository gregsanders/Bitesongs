<br>I'M YOUR REVOLUTION
<br>
<br>(1)
<br>She's uneasy in an easy way
<br>Something in her world's gone a little astray
<br>Loosening up the hold it once had on her mind.
<br>Tell me again how you lost the magic
<br>Things would be different if you still had it
<br>Tell me again you tried everything
<br>She said no, no, no
<br>
<br>CHORUS:
<br>You love to shake things down
<br>You love a little confusion
<br>You love to live in your own world
<br>And you don't need love's illusions
<br>The world keeps turning 'round
<br>In a mild electrocution
<br>You're looking for a change --
<br>looking for a change --
<br>I'm your Revolution.
<br>
<br>(2)
<br>She crossed over wish some hesitation
<br>The fine little line between love and resignation
<br>Hoping that someone would find her and make it alright.
<br>Mother taught her how to live with the madness
<br>Father allowed there were times when he had his
<br>Faith shaken up and his pride broken down so low
<br>
<br>[CHORUS]
