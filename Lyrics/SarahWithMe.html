<br>SARAH WITH ME
<br>
<br>CHORUS:
<br>Sarah are you with me?
<br>Or are you flying away again by yourself?
<br>Baby, can I reach you?
<br>Or are you gone to that place where no one can help?
<br>(1)
<br>You know it feels so strong
<br>When she reaches out and I know the worst is over.
<br>But when the naked night's on fire
<br>I swear there's not a man who could really know her.
<br>I'll hold on to the very end
<br>Whatever that might mean, but lord I'm getting scared
<br>Who are you and who am I
<br>And who is it I'm loving anyway?
<br>
<br>BRIDGE:
<br>But I can't stop the rain from falling honey
<br>I can't stop the wind from roaring in your head
<br>But I would give my life to be there with you baby
<br>My arms a shelter, my shoulder a bed.
<br>
<br>[CHORUS]
<br>
<br>(2)
<br>Who are you and who am I
<br>Do we stand a chance right now of being together?
<br>A voice is telling me there's a reason to be
<br>There's a reason to keep it alive forever.
<br>She goes walking in a faraway place
<br>Where she talks to ghosts and her pretty face is shadowed
<br>Come back, can you hear me child?
<br>Don't take away the only love I bad.
<br>
<br>[BRIDGE]
<br>
<br>[CHORUS]
