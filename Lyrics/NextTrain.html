<br />Next Train
<br />
<br />1.
<br />Baby I know my temper isn't always the best
<br />From time to time I lose it 
<br />And you know the rest
<br />This time I can see 
<br />That something's very wrong
<br />Now you better tell me 
<br />And it better not take long
<br />
<br />CHORUS:
<br />By the time the next train goes by
<br />I want to know what you've done.
<br />By the time the next train goes by
<br />I want to know what's going on
<br />
<br />2.
<br />Baby I know I've been drinking
<br />And I won't pretend
<br />That we don't have our problems
<br />When my elbow's bending
<br />But I can see just straight enough 
<br />To see that you've been crying
<br />And baby your condition 
<br />Looks a whole lot worse than mine.
<br />
<br />(CHORUS)

<br />BRIDGE:
<br />Well the click and the clack 
<br />Of that old railway track
<br />Is like the tick and the tock 
<br />Of that big railroad clock
<br />Sometimes baby you're better off if you talk.
<br />
<br />3.
<br />Baby I will count to five
<br />You just dry your little eyes
<br />I can walk away and never know
<br />Or we can keep this love alive
<br />You know it's not so very far
<br />That I can't stumble home
<br />Throw myself in bed alone
<br />Think of those times gone by
<br />And listen to the last train go by.
<br />
<br />(CHORUS)
