<br>Long Life Without You
<br>It's gonna be a full moon when I set out tonight
<br>It's gonna be an empty bottle when I'm done
<br>I got two short minutes 'til my time is up
<br>but it'll be a long race when it's run.
<br>I got razor blades in my brain tonight
<br>I got evil spirits in my beer
<br>But it'll be no sharp knife
<br>Come and take my life.
<br>I'll be a little boy in the morning
<br>I'll be a madman tomorrow night
<br>And if the words I say don't give me away
<br>Then I'll be slipping out of sight.
<br>It'll be a cold day down below
<br>When you don't get where you want to go
<br>And deep inside I know
<br>Deep inside I know
<br>It was gonna be love
<br>To hold us in this mad mad world
<br>It was gonna be us instead of two
<br>It was gonna be magic and sparks
<br>But instead it's all dark
<br>And it's gonna be a long life without you...
<br>I'm gonna eat hate and nails for my bread tonight
<br>I'm gonna drink gunpowder and gin
<br>I'll be watching like a hawk and my door will be unlocked
<br>In case you should come wandering in.
<br>[Bridge]
<br>[Chorus]
