<br>CHORUS
<br>(chanted)
<br>YoYo YoYo YoYo YoYo YoYo, YoYoGirl.
<br>
<br>VERSE
<br>She travels through time in that old jacket of mine and somehow comes back late.
<br>She believes in ghosts and she fears them the most when she's least afraid.
<br>
<br>There's a puzzle she fits in but she never does listen when you show her the way there.
<br>She travels through space 'cause she can't stay in one place--she's on a wing and no prayer.
<br>
<br>She can rise to the highest, then come down to crucify us with no regrets.
<br>There's a swamp that she lives in where the spirit finally gives in to her threats.
<br>
<br>The gods don't try to stop her, this cosmic teeny-bopper on a fast track to a brick wall.
<br>They don't know where it leads and neither does she and the suspense is killing us all.
<br>
<br>A whisper or two can sometimes get through to the one inside.
<br>But you're kidding yourself if you believe you can help her take it all in stride.
<br>
<br>She streams on up then down then back at the sound of a voice that only she can hear.
<br>She bounces high and low, we're not sure where she goes but she sees it all so clear.
