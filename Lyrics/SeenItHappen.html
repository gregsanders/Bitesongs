<br>Seen It Happen
<br>Never in a thousand kisses
<br>Never in a million years
<br>Not as long as I'm still standing here
<br>Hop a train with my last dollar
<br>Hop a fence and run through the dark
<br>Not as long as I don't miss my mark
<br>Break my heart but you won't hurt me
<br>Break your own and listen sad
<br>Still in all it's love you know you had
<br>It's not a change of heart that kills you
<br>It's just time that wears and flows
<br>That's what you're afraid of love I know
<br>'Cause I seen it happen that way
<br>Way too many times
<br>The sad and salty stories
<br>And those pick-up lines
<br>'Cause I seen it happen that way
<br>Way too many times
<br>We're looking babe
<br>But we don't see the same signs.
<br>Never will a love so shallow
<br>Take the place of a love so deep
<br>Don't you think you'll find it again so easily
<br>'Cause I'm not going anywhere babe
<br>You can run but don't go far
<br>Take your time 'cause I'm gonna keep your hearl
<br>(chorus)
<br>Don't you know you're not bound to leave me
<br>'Cause fire burning's still fire red
<br>Now we've got to go where it has led
<br>Never will a love so shallow
<br>Take the place of one so deep
<br>Now we've sown and now we've got to reap.
