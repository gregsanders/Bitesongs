<br>Ain't Gettin' Up
<br>Well I made an agreement on the day I was born
<br>I wouldn't raise no hell if I could get my own
<br>A bit of roof up over my head
<br>A hard day's work for a little bit of bread.
<br>
<br>There's nothing but dirt as far as I can see
<br>Lots of busted-up lives and lots of people like me
<br>People struggling just to get along
<br>I thought I could take it but I guess I was wrong
<br>
<br>(Bridge)
<br>And Oh it's been so long
<br>Since I had any reason to sing my song
<br>And Oh it's been so long
<br>Since I even tried.
<br>
<br>But this house and this street
<br>and this town and this world
<br>got nothing left to say
<br>to me and my girl
<br>
<br>(chorus) And I I I ain't gettin' up for this
<br>I'll walk across the world for love or money
<br>But I ain't getin' up for this.
<br>
<br>You can get me to move if you can tell me why
<br>Tell me things will get better before I die
<br>If death had a home it would be this street
<br>If hope ever came here she would turn and weep.
<br>
<br>What are you thinking mister big boss man
<br>Come up and get me if you think that you can
<br>Children are struggling just to get along
<br>You thought we would take it but I guess you were wrong
<br>[Bridge]
<br>[Chorus]
