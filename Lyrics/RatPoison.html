<br>Rat Poison
<br>I've seen you hangin' around
<br>You cast your eye on that jewel I found
<br>Just let me make one thing clear
<br>Old friend there's nothing for you around here
<br>Only one thing for guys of your type
<br>You keep hanging 'round 'til your plans are ripe
<br>But I got news and I don't mean good
<br>You better head out 'cause it's understood
<br>I got some rat poison
<br>The best you deserve
<br>Rat poison
<br>You really got the nerve
<br>I know your type so well
<br>You pick the fruit and move on to someone else
<br>But not this time, it won't be
<br>For once I got something good for me
<br>(Bridge)
<br>(Chorus)
