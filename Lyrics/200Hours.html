<br>200 Hours
<br>
<br>1.
<br>Two hundred hours and I'm doing alright
<br>Just about a week and it still ain't right
<br>Wishing someone would disconnect me 
<br>I've been in a haze since you left me
<br>
<br>2.
<br>The voices in my head and on the radio
<br>They say come on 
<br>A little man sitting on my shoulder 
<br>is whispering things I should have told her
<br>
<br>Bridge
<br>They won't let me forget you
<br>They want me to go get you
<br>They don't want me to let you slip away
<br>well, all I got to say is
<br>
<br>Chorus
<br>Take me somewhere
<br>Where she's not gonna be
<br>A room that's dark and smoky where I can't see
<br>There's nothing worse than a maudlin verse 
<br>That says 'then they fall in love'
<br>when it just can't be
<br>So take me somewhere--
<br>Anywhere but where she is.
<br>
<br>3.
<br>As a matter of fact I think I'm coming back
<br>I got my head together and I'm right on track
<br>Just one thing you got to do my friend
<br>Kill me if I got to see her again
<br>
<br>4.
<br>The little man on my shoulder's fine
<br>He's drifting off, you know he loves his wine
<br>While he's sleeping I'll slip away
<br>and dream of the things that I'm gonna say
<br>
