<br>DODGING THE LEVELLER
<br>I've always been an exceptional child
<br>Don't have to cope with the normal worries
<br>Other people's destiny
<br>I've never felt applied to me.
<br>
<br>(Chorus)
<br>I've been dodging the great leveller
<br>A sharp eye out and I know I can do it
<br>I've got to keep my wits about me
<br>More are going down every day
<br>
<br>
<br>Some older women shake their heads
<br>Think they know just what's coming to me.
<br>But I don't argue--that's not for me.
<br>They may know best but it's not for me.
<br>
<br>(Chorus)
<br>
<br>I've seen the numb and useless wrecks
<br>I've seen the throbbing side-effects
<br>of someone's climb to martyrdom-
<br>well I'm convinced that I won't come.
<br>
<br>(Chorus)
<br>
