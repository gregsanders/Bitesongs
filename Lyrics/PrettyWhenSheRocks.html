<br>PRETTY WHEN SHE ROCKS
<br>Well I never really liked her
<br>When I saw her on the street
<br>Her mama taught her how to walk
<br>And she never missed a beat
<br>
<br>And I'd see her around in the schoolyard
<br>Never cared too much
<br>A little distant a little dumb
<br>And a not-so-magic touch
<br>But I had to open my eyes
<br>
<br>When she finally took me by surprise
<br>She's so pretty when she rocks and rolls
<br>She's so pretty when she rocks and rolls.
<br>
<br>Well I know she's not my style
<br>But I look her way once in a while
<br>Her sister gave her them clothes to wear
<br>She's such a stupid child
<br>
<br>And I'd see her around in them places
<br>I'd never set foot in the door
<br>She'3 just one in a million faces
<br>Girl what're you going there for?
<br>But I had to open my eyes....
