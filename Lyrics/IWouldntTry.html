<br>I Wouldn't Try
<br>
<br>Chorus
<br>I can' take my eyes off you
<br>I wouldn't try
<br>Don't wait for me to play games with you 
<br>I wouldn't lie, I wouldn't lie
<br>I can't take my eyes off you 
<br>I wouldn't try
<br>
<br>1.
<br>Far on the other side
<br>I see you stop and wonder and start to hide
<br>Well I don't mind, I'm used to looking sideways
<br>But not this time--
<br>I'm gonna follow my gaze
<br>All around wherever it'll wander 
<br>Maybe stay with you a little longer
<br>
<br>2.
