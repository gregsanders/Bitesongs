<br>M A D
<br>There was a sickly new glow on the horizon
<br>In nineteen fifty-nine
<br>An ugly thought in the minds of the masters
<br>On both sides of the line.
<br>
<br>We traded in our old toys
<br>Got a bigger bang for our buck-
<br>It's just that there's no going back
<br>This time we're out of luck.
<br>
<br>MAD-  Mutual Assured Destruction
<br>MAD-  Mutual Assured Destruction
<br>MAD- [.Mutual Assured Destruction
<br>
<br>
<br>This shrewd prognosis has become our neurosis
<br>in the age of M - A - D
<br>Our descent under the nuclear umbrella
<br>Like our descent down from the tree
<br>
<br>(Chorus)
