<br>Roxy
<br>
<br>Roxy, can't you see
<br>You're taking the roadrunner out of me
<br>It's driving me crazy, I believe
<br>You want me to be something I don't want to be
<br>
<br>You listen to your mother
<br>She asked if I'd make it to the top--
<br>Now all I hear from you baby
<br>is Go get a better job!
<br>
<br>I got a bonded letter
<br>The Generals wanted my name.
<br>You told me your brother's in the army
<br>And I should do the same...
<br>
<br>Last night I went out drinking
<br>And driving with the boys
<br>Roxy, I know what you're thinking
<br>And I'm starting to hate your voice...
<br>
