GIMME BACK MY SMOKESTACK
<BR>What am I rising so early for?
<BR>How can I breathe when the air's so pure?
<BR>How can I look my woman in the eye
<BR>When there's nothing on the table for the kids tonight?
<BR>What am I doing this for?
<BR>What can I say when I walk through the door?
<BR>What can I bring to this fest
<BR>when my hands are empty coming back to the nest?
<BR>
<BR>(chorus)   So gimme gimme gimme back my smokestack...
<BR>
<BR>Where is my daily bread gonna come from?
<BR>If there's any out there I'm gonna get me some.
<BR>What is the point in me slavin' away
<BR>When I only get further back every day?
<BR>Is there any good reason for me to be here
<BR>When I can't do a thing for the ones I hold dear
<BR>I'm gonna stew in my juices at the bar and grill
<BR>And if I come out alive I'll be ready to kill...
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>(chorus) So gimme gimme gimme back my smokestack.
