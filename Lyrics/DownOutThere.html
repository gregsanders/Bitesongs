<br>DOWN OUT THERE
<br>
<br>1.
<br>Don't look now mama
<br>Cause it's really coming down out there
<br>You can hardly see the ground
<br>In front of your feet
<br>If you try to get around out there
<br>
<br>Little sister
<br>It's really coming down out there
<br>You can hardly see the road 
<br>In front of your wheels
<br>If you try to get away out there
<br>
<br>CHORUS
<br>If it keeps on raining
<br>It'll wash out another day
<br>If it keeps coming down 
<br>It could wash this whole place away
<br>
<br>2.
<br>Don't look now mama
<br>Cause it's really coming down out there
<br>I know I said I'd go out today 
<br>And give it just one more prayer
<br>
<br>Little sister
<br>I never meant to let you down
<br>I know I said I'd pack my things
<br>And give it just another round
<br>
<br>(CHORUS)
<br>
<br>BRIDGE
<br>And I long since lost track of the time
<br>But it's starting to show in these eyes of mine
<br>See it sometimes rains and it sometimes pours
<br>But sure never shines around here no more
<br>
<br>3.
<br>Don't look now mama
<br>Cause it's starting to come down in here
<br>It's running thru the cracks 
<br>Running thru the corners
<br>And breaking up with our worst fears
<br>
<br>Little sister
<br>I know I said we'd make it alright
<br>I know I said we could make it through
<br>If we just hold tight
<br>
<br>(CHORUS)
