<br>VERSE
<br>There's a way-out baby
<br>With an indigo mood.
<br>There's a puple satin storm in a human form
<br>with a lavender attitude.
<br>
<br>There's a vision I've been seeing
<br>of a soul in distress.
<br>There's a dream that keeps recurring,
<br>A feeling that you're stirring up,
<br>Now I'm on a quest.
<br>
<br>There's a way out baby--
<br>There's a road that I know.
<br>It'll take us far from here
<br>from the demons that you fear
<br>from the wounds that hurt you so.
