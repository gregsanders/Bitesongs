<br>USHER'S HOUSE
<br>Brick by brick... 
<br>Little by little...
<br>This lily-white scene
<br>is rotting out from the middle.
<br>
<br>Strong hands built it
<br>with fourteen-hour days.
<br>It's looking grayer
<br>for whoever has to stay.
<br>
<br>CHORUS  
<br>Usher's house is coming down around my ears
<br>I fall apart like the rubble, it festers like all my tea
<br>It's so thick in the air, you can breathe it if you dare
<br>'cause you sure aren't going anywhere.
<br>
<br>Where will I be
<br>when my son is someone's father
<br>should I even bother
<br>thinking that far ahead...
<br>
<br>This vision of my life
<br>looks too much like tomorrow.
<br>All I see's the sorrow
<br>of these walls falling down.
<br>
<br>CHORUS
