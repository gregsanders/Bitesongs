<br>VERSE
<br>When I look into your ebony eyes
<br>So many colors I can't recognize.
<br>Down so deep, they take me by surprise
<br>I want to see how they look from the inside.
<br>
<br>They say what we don't know we fear.
<br>But I can't take my mind off you dear.
<br>Everybody loves a mystery
<br>And this one's driving me, driving me.
<br>
<br>CHORUS
<br>There's a world of difference
<br>A world of difference now.
<br>There's a world of difference since I've seen 
<br>Blue and yellow don't have to make green.
