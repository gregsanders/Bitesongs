<br>Wait for Me
<br>
<br>1.
<br>Wait for me 
<br>In stillness and in light
<br>You bring it into focus
<br>But I couldn't see you right
<br>I tried to find you
<br>I tried to come to you
<br>You left me slipping in the rain.
<br>
<br>BRIDGE:
<br>I woke up early
<br>And I went down to where you lay
<br>I wanted to tell you 
<br>But I couldn't find the words to say.
<br>
<br>CHORUS:
<br>I know you'll wait for me
<br>Though the tears will fall
<br>One then another
<br>I know you'll wait for me
<br>'Cause we wanted it
<br>We'll be together.
<br>
<br>2.
<br>You come to me
<br>Poison in your eyes
<br>Singing sweetly love songs 
<br>Though I couldn't raise my eyes to cry
<br>I tried to love you
<br>I tried to come to you
<br>You left me slipping in the rain.
<br>
<br>(BRIDGE)
<br>
<br>(CHORUS)
<br>
<br>3.
<br>You come to me 
<br>In the morning time
<br>You come to me in spite
<br>You come to me forever
<br>Why couldn't you come tonight?
<br>
<br>(CHORUS)
