<br>VERSE
<br>A little bit of stormy weather 
<br>Might sweep us closer together
<br>We could turn it up a little louder
<br>light the fuse on this keg of powder
<br>
<br>BRIDGE
<br>All alone 
<br>Is always wrong 
<br>In this old world
<br>I've been thinking
<br>All along 
<br>There's another hand to hold.
<br>
<br>
<br>CHORUS
<br>There's a feeling that you'll
<br>Still be here in a year or two.
<br>A feeling that you were with me long before we met.
<br>Deja you, deja me, 
<br>Deja waking up beside you like today
<br>And loving it that way.
