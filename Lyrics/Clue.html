<br>Clue
<br>
<br>1.
<br>You ride by
<br>I'm falling over my feet
<br>I think my face is turning red
<br>I got to stutter-stutter something to say
<br>And then I think I'm falling down...
<br>
<br>2.
<br>You ride away
<br>I want to shuffle off and die
<br>I want to kill myself I never got the words to say what I want to say
<br>I'm gonna say it someday...
<br>
<br>CHORUS
<br>I don't have a clue
<br>What these feelings mean to you
<br>
<br>3.
<br>You come away 
<br>and my head is in the stars
<br>Cause I got dreams like anyone 
<br>and baby you're in some of them too
<br>I want to come away with you...
<br>
<br>4.
<br>We're drinking wine
<br>The world is spinning away
<br>It's just a moment in a million 
<br>And I think I'm falling further with you
<br>I want to fall in love with you...
<br>
