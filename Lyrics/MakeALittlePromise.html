<br>MAKE A LITTLE PROMISE
<br>
<br>CHORUS:
<br>Good love to be had with you girl
<br>All I gotta do is make a little promise
<br>Good love and we'll find our own world to live in.
<br>Good love to be had with you child
<br>All I gotta. do is wait a little while
<br>Good love and our own little style of living.
<br>
<br>(1)
<br>I got a place I like to call home
<br>But I don't like to be there alone
<br>And I got a way I call my own
<br>But it's starting to seem like old dry bones
<br>There's a time in every lifetime
<br>When you leave old friends behind
<br>And you think it's a fine line
<br>Waiting and watching for a sign
<br>
<br>(2)
<br>I got a girl with a song to sing
<br>And a couple of pretty rings
<br>
<br>
<br>BRIDGE:
<br>I want to make it clear
<br>Ain't no rain clouds
<br>Gonna chase me away from here.
<br>
<br>[CHORUS]
<br>
<br>(3)
<br>I got a friend who says I'm wrong
<br>He's been saying that all along
<br>Him and the boys are gonna call my bluff
<br>They don't know I've had enough
<br>Of fun and running around
<br>They don't know just what I've found
<br>I'm not the hurting kind
<br>And I'm never gonna change my mind.
<br>
<br>[BRIDGE]
<br>
<br>[CHORUS]
