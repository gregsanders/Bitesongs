<br>Seven More Steps
<br>
<br>1.
<br>Seven more steps 
<br>Push onward thru the mocking cold
<br>A solid wall of rock at my right hand
<br>A hundred feet below me
<br>The river roars and rumbles
<br>It's death by any other name
<br>
<br>2.
<br>Seven more steps
<br>Til I walk thru that shadowy door
<br>If I could only push on to redemption
<br>Six more steps until I find sweet surcease
<br>Faith faith I feel the end is near
<br>
<br>3.
<br>Seven miles ahead
<br>Where the river meets the plain
<br>Will you really leave your world to be beside me
<br>Six more steps 
<br>until I lay my body down
<br>Faith, faith I feel the end is near.
