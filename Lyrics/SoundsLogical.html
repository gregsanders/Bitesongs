<br />SOUNDS LOGICAL
<br />
<br />1.
<br />Baby said no one's taken my place
<br />But a couple of looks at the look on her face
<br />And I... I'm not so sure.
<br />She said if you love me you'll be still
<br />I said Jill I would if I could
<br />But she said baby, all the more.
<br />
<br />2.
<br />Baby says I should clean up my mind
<br />And listen to the positive vibes 
<br />But I've got feet of clay
<br />She said if you think good you'll feel good
<br />I said Jill I would if I could
<br />And she said baby what's love for?
<br />
<br />BRIDGE:
<br />Of all the stupid things
<br />She said love's the thing with wings
<br />
<br />CHORUS:
<br />Sounds logical to me
<br />Oh it sure makes sense to me
<br />I think I finally see
<br />Sounds logical to me
<br />It sure makes sense to me
<br />Sure it does
<br />
<br />3.
<br />Baby said I should look for the signs
<br />Words are not for us kindred minds
<br />But I need them all the same
<br />She said if you look you can see truth
<br />I said Jill I'm looking for truth
<br />And she said whatever for?
<br />
<br />(BRIDGE)
<br />
<br />(CHORUS)
