<br>VERSE
<br>There was a way you used to touch my face,
<br>Send me floating out to that sacred place.
<br>I knew all the while that this was no lover's haze,
<br>Together we joined ourselves in a soul embrace.
<br>
<br>CHORUS
<br>I won't try to tell you I just don't understand 
<br>or our love just never took root.
<br>I know well enough the power of your touch
<br>But not every flower bears fruit.
<br>
<br>There was a sign
<br>I made up my mind
<br>It was by design
<br>The fault was all mine
