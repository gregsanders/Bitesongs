<br>
<br>NEVER HEAR THE WIND
<br>
<br>CHORUS:
<br>My love will blow away,
<br>And you'll never hear the wind.
<br>A sandcastle washed by waves,
<br>You don't hear the ocean sing.
<br>
<br>(1)
<br>Your eyes are filled with colors and comedies.
<br>You're tuned in to an alien frequency
<br>How can I hope to break into your spell
<br>I never know what stories to tell.
<br>Midnigbt comes and you've lost all track of time
<br>The end of August and you're glowing like sunshine
<br>But when the winds turn darker and cold
<br>You get too stormy far me to hold.
<br>
<br>[CHORUS]
<br>
<br>(2) 
<br>You look at me like a black and white movie
<br>A silent picture with no color or sound
<br>If I could paint for you, if I could sing for you
<br>Tell you a love story truer than true.
<br>There was a time when you would smile and make room for me
<br>When I aroused your curly curiosity
<br>But you always liked to shuffle the cards
<br>I want to keep you but you make it so hard.  
<br>
<br>[CHORUS]
<br>
<br>(3)
<br>No one ever said we were made for one another
<br>But fate was willing we should give it a. try
<br>I know I'm down and out, but I refuse to doubt
<br>Bring on another day and never say 'die'
<br>
<br>[CHORUS]
<br>
