<br>You Said She Said
<br>
<br>1.
<br>Talk to her for me 
<br>Find out what's going thru her head
<br>Try and make her see
<br>You always were the best of friends.
<br>You coulndn't do this
<br>You wouldn't do this 
<br>You wouldn't do this to me.
<br>
<br>CHORUS:
<br>That's what you said she said
<br>And I know it can't be true
<br>Still the same I can't explain 
<br>Why she ran from me to you
<br>That's what you said she said 
<br>But I know it is a lie
<br>Still and yet I can't forget 
<br>That strange look in her eye.
<br>
<br>2.
<br>Come straight up with me, man
<br>I know there's been some fooling around
<br>Come on let it be man
<br>You always make me look like a clown.
<br>You coulndn't do this
<br>You wouldn't do this 
<br>You wouldn't do this to me.
<br>
<br>(CHORUS)
<br>
<br>BRIDGE:
<br>I guess I never understood her anyway
<br>But I wish she could have found another way.
<br>
<br>(CHORUS)
<br>
<br>That's what you said she said
<br>That's what you said she said
<br>That's what you said she said
