<br>See it as it is
<br>Sometimes you want so bad
<br>For everything to be right
<br>You tell yourself things are good
<br>It's okay just hold on another day
<br>Everything will be like it should
<br>
<br>But the blood has flowed
<br>The wound's already open
<br>No soft wish in the cool cool dawn
<br>Can take back the words that we've spoken.
<br>
<br>(chorus)
<br>Haven't I tried a thousand times
<br>To paint things in different colors
<br>Close my eyes to the others
<br>I see it as it is.
<br>
<br>Don't I know the seed was sown
<br>Just wouldn't admit the worst and
<br>Now that the bubble is burst
<br>I see it as it is.
<br>
<br>We walked together in the starlit dark
<br>Like I could have walked forever
<br>But something in you left a little mark
<br>And I should have known you'd never never
<br>
<br>You'd never be able
<br>To bring our love inside
<br>So we went on pretending
<br>I wouldn't see what you couldn't hide.
