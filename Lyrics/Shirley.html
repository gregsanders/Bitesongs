<br>Shirley (Got that Game)
<br>(with apologies to Shirley Ellis)
<br>
<br>1.
<br>Just when you thought it was safe to go back downtown
<br>Walk in the place and the word is rolling round and round
<br>She thought she had it made
<br>Never ever have to fade away
<br>But Shirley's got that game going again
<br>
<br>2.
<br>It's just a rhythm, a way of walking with that beat
<br>Whatever it is well she got it and she makes it sweet
<br>She don't need no kiss of fire
<br>It all lights up and burns when I walk by her
<br>And Shirley's got that game going again
<br>
<br>3.
<br>She's not so special
<br>But words make it all alright
<br>She's got a way with them 
<br>Making magic from the night
<br>She don't need to try so hard
<br>She laughs it all right off when they walk by her
<br>
