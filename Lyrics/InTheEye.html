In the Eye
<html><body>
<br>1. 
<br>Once upon a time 
<br>When I could look you in the eye
<br>Our thoughts would flash and vie
<br>But tonight I looked away.
<br>
<br>2.
<br>One day someday I'll come around 
<br>And look straight into your stare
<br>But casually now I turn aside
<br>And pretending not to care.
<br>
<br>CHORUS:
<br>'Cause I don't like my way
<br>And I don't need no friends today
<br>And I could never be the one 
<br>On who you can depend.
<br>
<br>BRIDGE:
<br>How when I hate myself 
<br>Can your eyes look so honestly at me?
<br>My heart holds lonely poison
<br>A breath of insecurity
<br>Just trust me and let me be
<br>I'll come again when I can walk like a man
<br>and not some animal not at home in its cage.
<br>
<br>I turn to face it and I find thunder
<br>I burn a bottle and litle wonder
<br>When things turn dark I never bother to understand.
<br>I'm 24 and I've learned for a long time 
<br>It's better to hide than to face it at the wrong time
<br>Nothing but the wall gets hurt if I'm left all alone.
<br>
<br>3.
<br>One steep sudden slide 
<br>And then dark disconnected lines 
<br>And tender trying times 
<br>And I climb for higher ground.
<br>
<br>4.
<br>One erratic haggard boy 
<br>Is no cause for alarm
<br>And Wednesday morning's bitter mood's
<br>Just the storm before the calm.
<br>
<br>(CHORUS)
