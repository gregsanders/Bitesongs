<br>ONE TOUGH COOKIE
<br>(1)
<br>Elizabeth said to me
<br>Don't wish on the stars my friend-
<br>Some day they're gonna fade away
<br>And where will your wish be tben
<br>
<br>(2)
<br>Elizabeth laughs sometimes
<br>But its a laugh without any joy
<br>She gives me a look that says
<br>"Don't you misunderstand me Boy' '
<br>
<br>BRIDGE
<br>It's not love she's looking for
<br>In the sad strange place she calls home
<br>She just loves to say "I told you so"
<br>When she wakes up there alone.
<br>
<br>CHORUS:
<br>She's one tough cookie and it makes me sad
<br>She turns her back on love she never had
<br>She's one bard puzzle and it makes me feel
<br>She never looks past what she thinks is real
<br>And. it makes me sad.
<br>
<br>(3)
<br>There once was a little girl
<br>Lying sofa in her daddy's lap
<br>It sure didn't take her long
<br>'Til she left there and never looked back.
<br>
<br>(4)
<br>Now maybe the world has been
<br>So unkind to her fragile heart
<br>Or maybe she never gave it
<br>A chance from the very start.
<br>

<br>[CHORUS]
