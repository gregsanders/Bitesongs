<br>45 Degrees of Dark
<br>
<br>1.
<br>A nothing night
<br>Forty-five degrees of dark
<br>My freezing fingers 
<br>don't even ask me where I'm walking to
<br>
<br>BRIDGE / CHORUS
<br>I don't belong here
<br>You don't belong there
<br>And this chill doesn't belong in the air
<br>I got no feeling left 
<br>but who needs feeling since you left
<br>I know, not me
<br>
<br>Forty-five degrees of dark 
<br>Is all there ever was or ever will be 
<br>It's all I can see
<br>
<br>2.
<br>Racing time
<br>Want to see which one moves slower
<br>Racing the sunset 
<br>Want to see which one sinks lower and colder and...
<br>
<br>Bridge/Chorus
