<br>CHORUS
<br>Touch you where there was someone
<br>Now there is no one
<br>Nothing but you and me.
<br>
<br>Touch you where there was no one
<br>Now there is someone 
<br>Someone like you and me.
<br>
<br>VERSE
<br>Seeds are funny things how they break out and grow
<br>Into what is the question--I don't want to know.
<br>Now who is the grower and who is the seed
<br>And in the middle of it all are you getting what you need?
<br>
<br>I love solving riddles and it's nobody's fault
<br>that I never figured out what makes the pendulum swing.
<br>You want fries with that, you want ketchup or salt,
<br>You want everything everything everything everything.
<br>
<br>(CHORUS)
<br>
<br>VERSE
<br>You know pretty baby I'm with you all the way
<br>But I don't claim to fathom a word that you say.
<br>...
