<br>COMIN IN LOVE
<br>
<br>1.
<br>Well listen little sister 
<br>While I stutter and trip
<br>Over the words I've been thinking to bring
<br>About a glittering girl 
<br>Who walked into my world
<br>With a song I was ready to sing
<br>
<br>She says say it all tell it all 
<br>Baby be my baby doll
<br>Let's take a little, just make a little
<br>Just gimme one more chance to slip away
<br>
<br>CHORUS
<br>I could speak my mind
<br>I could sing about it all day long
<br>I could write a book about the way you look
<br>But it's easier to say... 
<br>I'm comin in love with you
<br>
<br>2.
<br>Well the girl I was saying 
<br>Is a-coming my way
<br>And my gaze runs straight to her face
<br>With a sparkle and shine 
<br>Her hands reach out for mine
<br>And a smile I can almost taste
<br>
<br>She says bring it up, let it up
<br>Butter be my buttercup
<br>Let's take a little, just make a little
<br>Just gimme one more chance to slip away
<br>
<br>(CHORUS)
<br>
<br>3.
<br>Well you want to know a secret 
<br>I've been trying to keep 
<br>About the way that I'm starting to feel
<br>About a bright-eyed girl 
<br>Who came into my world
<br>With a kiss I was ready to steal
<br>
<br>She says come with me, run with me
<br>Honey be my honey bee
<br>Let's take a little, just make a little
<br>Just gimme one more chance to slip away
<br>
<br>(CHORUS)
