<br>Four Winds
<br>I'm not saying I depend on you for every step
<br>But I breathe easier with you here
<br>There's a glisten in your eye that soothes me to the touch
<br>And I step lighter with you by my side
<br>
<br>Hey I'm missing what those misty eyes been giving me
<br>When I was twisting in the wind
<br>It's no life sentence that I'm asking when I come to you 
<br>It's just love, streaming in
<br>
<br>CHORUS
<br>Don't you throw me to the four winds
<br>scatter me all over like a seed to be sown 
<br>Don't just slip me in the river
<br>to tumble down over the waterfall and out of your mind
<br>
<br>There's a reason why I fell across your path today
<br>Cause I was happier than you were
<br>I dreamed a dream of you and woke up with a laughing heart
<br>Now here I am to bring you all my smiles
<br>
<br>Hey I'm swifter than a river when it comes to you
<br>But I can't stand fast without your hand
<br>It's not so simple as the twinkling of an eye
<br>Here comes love rushing in
<br>
<br>(CHORUS)
<br>
