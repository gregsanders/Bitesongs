<br>VERSE
<br>You've had your share of ups and downs
<br>You're not the luckiest guy in town
<br>You've been bruised, your heart's been abused--
<br>You've played the fool, you've played the clown.
<br>
<br>But this is different, you've got to see
<br>No other woman plays as stright as she--
<br>Most other guys never get a second look.
<br>That second glance--the one that you mistook.
<br>
<br>This is a chance that you don't want to miss
<br>She's been intrigued since the day she met you
<br>You want to take her out and seal her with a kiss--
<br>Ask her pretty please... I betcha she'd let you.
