Good As Gold
<BR>Crawling along in the glare of the headlights
<BR>Wishing I could run and hide
<BR>I can't be hypnotized by bright lights
<BR>Or all the sirens that have lied.
<BR>
<BR>My pockets never been so empty
<BR>The coming days don't give me much to hold
<BR>Everything I have I could hold it in my own two hand
<BR>Holding you's as good as gold.
<BR>
<BR>Wishing with all my might you were with me
<BR>I know without knowing I can find you there
<BR>This hell's gonna blow away when you kiss me
<BR>When I got you I've got a prayer.
<BR>
<BR>My world has never felt so empty
<BR>Hope I get home before I get too old
<BR>Everything I have I could hold it in my own two hand;
<BR>Holding you's as good as gold.
<BR>
<BR>This world I'm walking through is a dirty one
<BR>I call it home but still you know somehow
<BR>I wouldn't think twice if I could burn it to the ground
<BR>At least there'd be more color here than now-
<BR>
