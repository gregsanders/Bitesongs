<br>BALANCED BUDGET
<br>
<br>We don't mind eating from this old tin can
<br>and I don't need new shoes, hell I'm a man.
<br>We're happy just sittin' round' and playing our guitars
<br>and Ronnie's got his missiles, now all of us are stars
<br>
<br>Balanced Budget
<br>Balanced Budget
<br>
<br>My old lady's after me to pay the rent,
<br>but I got no job and the money's all spent --
<br>The President's got problems just like me and you --
<br>He's got to feed an army and Nancy too.
<br>
<br>Balanced Budget
<br>Balanced Budget
<br>
<br>This cold water flat never looked so dear--
<br>We're gonna have a party with generic beer.
<br>The President would help me, he said so today
<br>but he needs every cent to blow the Russians away.
