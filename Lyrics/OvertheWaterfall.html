<br>VERSE
<br>She felt empty when she left their side
<br>Like a thief out into the night
<br>But he held her while her mother cried
<br>And her father watched her fade out of sight.
<br>
<br>Still half a child when she told him
<br>they would have to grow up now.
<br>He said they would find a way 
<br>To take care of the little one somehow.
<br>
<br>
<br>CHORUS
<br>And we feel drawn,
<br>Swept down,
<br>Over the waterfall.
<br>
<br>And we dream on,
<br>pulled strongly closer, 
<br>Over the waterfall.
