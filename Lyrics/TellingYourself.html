<br>Tellin' Yourself
<br>
<br>1.
<br>Come on tell
<br>What you been telling yourself
<br>Are you letting the days 
<br>and the doubts 
<br>wear you down
<br>Like a water torture in your mind
<br>
<br>Come on tell 
<br>What you been telling yourself
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Chorus
<br>There's a few things 
<br>We ought to be talking out out loud
<br>There's a few vultures that we better shoot down
<br>
