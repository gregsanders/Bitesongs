<br>Telling Yourself
<br>
<br>1.
<br>Come on tell
<br>What you been telling yourself
<br>Are you finding ghosts in all your closets
<br>Painting bogey men on all your walls?
<br>
<br>2.
<br>Come on tell
<br>What you been telling yourself
<br>Are finding some old evil one 
<br>To take my place?
<br>
<br>CHORUS:
<br>There's a thing or two
<br>We ought to be talking out out loud
<br>There's a few vultures that we better shoot down
<br>
<br>3.
<br>Come on tell
<br>What you been telling yourself
<br>Are you painting doubt like rouge on your face
<br>Painting tears in all your eyes?
<br>
<br>4.
<br>Come on tell
<br>What you been telling yourself
<br>Are you bringing clouds down out of the heavens
<br>Bringing rain out of the skies?
<br>
<br>5.
<br>Come on tell
<br>What you been telling yourself
<br>Are you letting the days and the doubts wear you down
<br>Like a water torture in your mind?
<br>
<br>(CHORUS)
