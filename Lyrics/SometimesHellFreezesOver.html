<br>VERSE
<br>False hopes can tear you apart
<br>New beginnings turn out to be false starts
<br>In the end, you learn to adapt
<br>Change what you can, the rest you accept.
<br>
<br>BRIDGE
<br>But for all the dreams you've buried
<br>In the cold and lifeless ground
<br>Now and then you wake up 
<br>And have to smile at what you've found
<br>
<br>CHORUS
<br>Sometimes lady luck comes to call
<br>Sometimes longshots win it all.
<br>Sometimes a field of weeds turns into four-leaf clovers
<br>And sometimes hell freezes over.
