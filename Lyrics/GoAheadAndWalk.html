GO AHEAD AND WALK
<BR>
<BR>CHORUS:
<BR>Go ahead and walk
<BR>Make my day
<BR>Go ahead and talk
<BR>Whatever you say
<BR>I'm gonna laugh it all away
<BR>'Cause I finally found myself today
<BR>
<BR>(1)
<BR>You won't see my light on tonight
<BR>When you're walking past my door
<BR>And you won't catch me calling you up
<BR>Just to hear your voice no more
<BR>I broke down the last time
<BR>I came crawling back the time before
<BR>And all those other times
<BR>You had me on my knees on the floor
<BR>
<BR>[CHORUS]
<BR>
<BR>It was easy for you when I was running scared 
<BR>And I didn't know who I was
<BR>You pulled the strings, I'd get up and sing
<BR>Like a good doll always does
<BR>But you feel better 
<BR>When you got someone you can push around
<BR>And I figured out you'd never feel 
<BR>Good enough to live that down.
<BR>
<BR>[CHORUS]
