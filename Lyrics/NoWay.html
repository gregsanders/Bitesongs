<br>No Way
<br>
<br>1.
<br>I wander round this place 
<br>Like some uneasy thief
<br>You ask me why I pace 
<br>and never look you in the face 
<br>and do I think I'm deep
<br>
<br>I know baby 
<br>I feel it as well
<br>The moment is magic
<br>But I tell myself
<br>
<br>CHORUS
<br>No way
<br>What are you thinking of
<br>Don't say
<br>I might fall
<br>No way
<br>By all the stars above
<br>Don't wave--
<br>I might fall.
<br>
<br>2.
<br>The sparks were flying high
<br>When we first met that day
<br>I asked you where you're from
<br>And you smiled saying something 'bout far away
<br>
<br>I know baby it was only yesterday
<br>But feeling what I'm feeling 
<br>makes me think I better say
<br>
<br>No way...
<br>
<br>3.
<br>The sun went down and gave
<br>gave us this starstruck night
<br>Time and space conspired 
<br>with our deep and dim desires to give us both the right
<br>
<br>I know baby it'll never be the same
<br>But I'll wake up in the morning 
<br>next to where you might have lain
