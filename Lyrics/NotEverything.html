<br>NOT EVERYTHING
<br>I bet you think I can't think about nothin' but you
<br>Well I do
<br>I got some cold beer and real loud music it's true
<br>Yes it's true
<br>You vain little thing a pretty picture for all the world to see
<br>Well not me
<br>Just 'cause your eyes sparkle doesn't mean you got a hold on me
<br>Well we'll see
<br>
<br>(Bridge) And I know you think you're on my mind
<br>I know you think your love's a different kind
<br>I bet you think I'm thinking 'bout you tonight
<br>
<br>(Chorus)  You're not everything
<br>Little girl you're not everything
<br>To me...
<br>
<br>Looking through the papers I don't see your name anywhere
<br>But I don't care
<br>I guess you're not headlines after all girl but don't despair
<br>Don't despair
<br>The grass is still growing and the flowers are still blooming red
<br>That's what I said
<br>The wind is still blowing and that old song is playing in my head
<br>In my head
<br>
<br>(Bridge)
<br>
<br>(Chorus)
<br>
