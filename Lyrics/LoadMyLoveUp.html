<br>LOAD MY LOVE UP
<br>
<br>CHORUS:
<br>Gonna load my love up with tenderness
<br>Lay my head on your shoulder and rest
<br>I'm gonna lash my troubles to a hollow log
<br>And watch them while they float away.
<br>I'm gonna save this love
<br>I'm gonna save this love
<br>I'm gonna save tbis love
<br>If it's the last thing I do.
<br>
<br>(1)
<br>Finally found a love that's as clear as a bell
<br>But Life outside can still be be hell
<br>Take a little anger, take a harsh word or two
<br>I carry them home and throw them at you.
<br>
<br>BRIDGE
<br>Stop me before I cross that line
<br>Start to unravel all the ties that bind
<br>Lord it only takes one moment of time
<br>To wash away a whole life of trying.
<br>
<br>[CHORUS]
<br>
<br>(2)
<br>Why is it that loneliness feels so unkind
<br>To make you go out in search far something so hard to find
<br>One day you find it, a love from the heart
<br>The next day you begin to tear it apart.
<br>
<br>BRIDGE
<br>I look around me for someone to blame
<br>But when the circle comes around you know it's always the same
<br>Lord how many times do I need to find out
<br>Time won't stand still while I'm wrestling with my doubt.
<br>
<br>(3)
<br>Tonight I'll listen close while she whispers her dreams
<br>And keep reminding myself things are as good as they seem.
<br>Look up above me to the stars in the sky
<br>But there's nothing written there 'bout how our love should survive.
<br>
<br>BRIDGE:
<br>I kept believing that fate held the key
<br>Our love would stand or fall by what was meant to be
<br>At long, long last I'm beginning to see
<br>That stand or fall, it's all up to me...
<br>
<br>[CHORUS]
