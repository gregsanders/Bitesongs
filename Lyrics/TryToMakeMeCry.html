<br>Try To Make Me Cry
<br>
<br>1.
<br>You aint no friend of mine
<br>But for the longest time
<br>I followed you around like a puppy dog
<br>Lord I was blind.
<br>
<br>2.
<br>You gave me sticks and stones
<br>Crumbs and bones
<br>You'd pat me on the head 
<br>And leave me standing there all alone
<br>
<br>CHORUS:
<br>But now the time has come
<br>For you to look me right straight in the eye
<br>Come on, come on and make me cry.
<br>
<br>3.
<br>It was a crying sin
<br>The way you did me in
<br>But which one was the fool 
<br>When I kept on letting you in
<br>
<br>4.
<br>But then the lightning struck
<br>Wouldn't it be my luck
<br>It brought me to my senses
<br>And I tore your letters up
<br>
<br>(CHORUS)
<br>
