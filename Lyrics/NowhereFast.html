<br>Nowhere Fast
<br>
<br>It breaks my heart when I feel the breezes
<br>I cant stand the test of time 
<br>and I'm going nowhere now
<br>I scurry, scream and make alot of faces 
<br>but I cant fool her you know 
<br>and I beter go to bed before it shows
<br>
<br>CHORUS
<br>And I'm out of time 
<br>I'm out of beer
<br>I'm out of everywhere but here
<br>In the thick of things another night went past
<br>I wake up knowing going nowhere fast
<br>
<br>There's this daydream I'll be gone in the morning
<br>If I have to sell everything
<br>work hard and make my name
<br>But right this minute there's something on the stove
<br>A joke or two and my baby's gray eyes
<br>the only hurry I'm in is to open that door.
<br>
<br>(CHORUS)
<br>
<br>It never took longer or more out of me
<br>to walk that mile home and see my steps cast echoes low
<br>I'll never get anywhere hanging around 
<br>Searching for a dollar to pave my way
<br>and I'm not sure I reall care
<br>
<br>(CHORUS)
