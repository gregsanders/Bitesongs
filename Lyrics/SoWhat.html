<br>So What
<br>
<br>1. 
<br>I heard about you and your little boy blue
<br>A pretty diamond ring 
<br>and I can't say a thing 
<br>but 'so what'
<br>
<br>You love him, he loves you
<br>You love the children and the dolphins too
<br>So what
<br>
<br>2.
<br>Your man I hear he's a real Clark Kent
<br>Today they made him vice president
<br>So what
<br>
<br>He bought a Mercedes
<br>And gave you the keys
<br>A house in the suburbs 
<br>Now you can't keep your big mouth shut
<br>So what
<br>
<br>CHORUS
<br>Let me tell you little girl
<br>Your life is a pretty pretty pearl
<br>But I'm standing here with my feet on the ground
<br>Down in my rut
<br>So what
<br>
<br>3.
<br>Saturday mornings at the charity
<br>You polish your halo for all to see
<br>So what
<br>
<br>I know you just a little too well
<br>You're dying to ask me when I'm gonna get out of my rut
<br>
<br>4.
<br>You work out together twice a week at the gym
<br>He loves you and you love him
<br>So what
<br>
<br>Your house will be perfect 
<br>your kids will be grand 
<br>And people like me just won't understand how rough
<br>So what
<br>
<br>(CHORUS)
