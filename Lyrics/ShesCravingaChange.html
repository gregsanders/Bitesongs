<br>VERSE
<br>No matter how the birds and the bees are singing in the trees
<br>The stars up above won't color what she sees
<br>Her eagle-eye finds the needle in the haystack each time.
<br>
<br>No matter how the stars and the moon are singing love's tune
<br>The devil's swept away but she's not gonna swoon.
<br>Sharpen up the blades, 'cause she's craving a change.
<br>
<br>CHORUS
<br>She's getting ready to change her luck
<br>So bring my bags and my old blue truck
<br>Better to move out of striking range
<br>'Cause I know she's craving a change.
<br>
<br>VERSE
<br>No matter how you beg how you plead how you bare your heart and bleed
<br>You can give her all your gold but never give her what she needs
<br>You call her and she hears, but it's falling on deaf ears this time.
<br>
<br>No matter what she says that she's thinking, she's sinking your ship
<br>She knows there's bluer oceans and she's dying for a sip.
<br>The west wind it blows her, she's one minute closer to gone.
