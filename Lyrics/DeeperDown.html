<br>Deeper Down
<br>One night isn't a lifetime no and
<br>One word isn't the only way to say it
<br>Try now and see the way it fits together.
<br>Bend my words into broken pieces
<br>You can't see what the wallpaper sees and
<br>You think that time has come and taken your dream;
<br>Saturday morning
<br>The world isn't gonna stop turning
<br>And I wonder what's becoming of love.
<br>It might be that the gold is fading
<br>It might be that the fire is smoldering
<br>But it's burning deeper down...
<br>Whispers that you been hearing in your dreams
<br>Will fade away when the blue sky gleams
<br>Now babe don't tell me that it isn't so
<br>Leaves turn red and then fall from the tree
<br>But wait 'til Spring and then tell me what you se'
<br>Love will grow if you give it time
<br>(Bridge)
<br>(Chorus)
