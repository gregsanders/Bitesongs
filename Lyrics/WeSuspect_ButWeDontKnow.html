<br>VERSE
<br>We believe what we read about in the papers every day
<br>And a man named Neil went walking on the moon
<br>We suspect that gremlins come each night and carry our things away
<br>Then disappear as we walk into the room.
<br>
<br>We're pretty sure someone out there knows us better than we know ourselves
<br>They sort through all the fortune cookies looking to find
<br>The one that's meant for us alone and our true fortune tells
<br>We make no claim, but the thought has crossed our minds.
<br>
<br>CHORUS
<br>Spirits and angels
<br>Lessons from strangers
<br>And a big bang before it all began.
<br>Love made in heaven 
<br>A purpose for living 
<br>And an animal called man.
<br>
<br>We can't prove that it's so
<br>But you can't make a move without
<br>Some ideas of your own-- 
<br>We suspect but we don't know.
