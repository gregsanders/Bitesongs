<br>
<br>MAKE A LIAR OUTTA YOU
<br>
<br>CHORUS:
<br>Time's gonna teach you a thing or two
<br>About what happens when you throw away a love so true
<br>I know you think you're gonna know just what to do
<br>But life's gonna make a liar outta you.
<br>
<br>(1)
<br>If you walk away you just might close the door forever.
<br>If you stay you might find you and me together
<br>It's a crazy world where nothing's ever what it seems
<br>You roll the dice and just throw down some money on your dreams
<br>
<br>BRIDGE:
<br>I got a love who's making all my dreams come true
<br>I gotta find a way to bring that dream to you
<br>I got to know if in this wicked old world
<br>There's one pure love that's true.
<br>
<br>[CHORUS]
<br>
<br>(2)
<br>If you sing along you know the melody will find you
<br>If it's wrong you can leave it all behind you
<br>There's a little light up in the windows of your heart now
<br>Open up the shutters and let the music start now
<br>
<br>[BRIDGE]
<br>
<br>[CHORUS]
<br>
<br>(3) 
<br>If we call it quits now we can't change our minds tomorrow
<br>If the feeling fits we can say goodbye to sorry
<br>You can lay your plans and try to make the world obey you
<br>But out on the ocean you can't tell the wind where to take you.
