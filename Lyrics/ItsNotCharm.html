<br>
<br>IT'S NOT CHARM
<br>
<br>(1)
<br>Honey Honey Honey Honey
<br>Put down that gun and come listen to me
<br>Five nights ago this stopped being funny
<br>Call off your dogs and let me down from this tree
<br>
<br>BRIDGE
<br>'Cause everything you said
<br>Is spinning in my head
<br>So let's calm down and talk
<br>Instead of lighting up the sky
<br>With our fire-fights.
<br>You weren't the loving kind
<br>'Til you changed your mind
<br>And you woke up one sunny day to find
<br>The things you'd never do,
<br>Well you just might.
<br>
<br>CHORUS
<br>It's not charm
<br>That got you where you been to
<br>You took a match to all the things I sent you
<br>How far you gonna make me run now
<br>I'm gonna find a way to catch up wtth you somehow
<br>
<br>(2) 
<br>Honey Honey Honey Honey
<br>Pack all your dreams in a bundle for me
<br>Wrap them in a blanket
<br>And let's go find a place to sit
<br>This game of yours ain't taking us nowhere.
<br>
<br>BRIDGE
<br>'Cause loving makes you mad
<br>And kissing makes you sad
<br>And when you don't you wish you had
<br>And either way it's always my problem
<br>I'm standing in the cold
<br>Trying to keep a hold
<br>Trying to buy back my things you sold
<br>And meanwhile the rain keeps a-falling
<br>
<br>[CHORUS]
