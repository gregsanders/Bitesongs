<br>Makes Me Feel Like Fighting
<br>
<br>1.
<br>Face to face after all of these years
<br>Looking back on the laughter and the tears 
<br>You and I in a different time
<br>Looking up at the mountains we would climb
<br>
<br>I see a red bird flying
<br>You try to tell me it's black or white
<br>I don't think so
<br>It's funny how we'll never know who's right
<br>
<br>CHORUS
<br>And it makes me feel like fighting
<br>I want to open your mind up and spill some light in
<br>It makes me feel like crying
<br>Does it matter to you that something good is dying
<br>And how I wish for times gone by
<br>In the firelight
<br>
<br>2.
<br>Now you tell me that wrong ain't wrong
<br>What you're saying is right ain't what you're fighting for
<br>Every time you start singing that song
<br>I tell myself you've sunk down a little more
<br>
<br>You've got an answer for everything
<br>It all fits together so fine
<br>Someday you'll realize 
<br>it's all inside your mind
<br>
<br>(CHORUS)
