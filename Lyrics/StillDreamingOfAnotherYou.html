<br>Still Dreaming (of another you)
<br>
<br>1.
<br>I can read her like a book
<br>From all the things we've done and said
<br>But I long to take another look
<br>At the pages still ahead
<br>
<br>Bridge
<br>I love to dream
<br>Of the pretty girls I've seen
<br>But the one that turns me on
<br>Is the one that you could be.
<br>So I've been thinking
<br>Thinking 'bout it baby
<br>Just hoping that maybe
<br>We could give it a try
<br>
<br>Chorus
<br>I wouldn't put it past you
<br>I wouldn't put it past you
<br>And I'm still dreaming of another you
<br>And I'm still dreaming of another you
<br>
<br>2.
<br>Seven years ago you stole my heart
<br>With all your pretty colors
<br>And believe me baby to this very day
<br>They ain't faded one bit duller
<br>
<br>Bridge / chorus
