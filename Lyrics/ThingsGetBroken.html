<br>Things Get Broken
<br>
<br>1.
<br>Silence of a darkness
<br>Fills my soul with troubled hazes
<br>Look at you full in the face
<br>And I'm surprised to find your eyes.
<br>I feel the gaze upon me
<br>When I'm cloudy new awakened
<br>Soft caresses like a love world
<br>Come and fill my eyes tonight.
<br>
<br>CHORUS:
<br>Every now and then 
<br>Things get broken
<br>Every now and then
<br>Things fall apart they fall apart
<br>Every now and then 
<br>Things get pushed up to the limit
<br>I fall apart
<br>
<br>2.
<br>Falling down the memory
<br>The aftershock of promises
<br>You don't see the crowd move
<br>When you go your starry way.
<br>I don't see the clouds move 
<br>When I stare into the sky
<br>All the heavens fall upon me
<br>And still I stare into the night.
<br>
<br>(CHORUS)
<br>
<br>3.
<br>Silence of a darkness
<br>There I lay me down to sleep
<br>Wake along the waters
<br>Making me recall my weakness.
<br>Fall down in the firestorm
<br>Walking through the colored pain
<br>You don't see the difference 
<br>When you cry and when I scream...
<br>
<br>(CHORUS)
