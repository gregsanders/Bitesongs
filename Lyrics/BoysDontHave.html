<br>What Boys Don't Have
<br>
<br>1.
<br>Deal me out of this one Jimmy
<br>Take my aces
<br>Me, I'm out the door
<br>To find whatever's in the cards for me tonight
<br>You boys play on without me
<br>Don't spare the beer 
<br>You know the night is young 
<br>But young or old I got to run
<br>
<br>Bridge
<br>I gotta get away
<br>Before my baby's gone away
<br>My mind can't last that long
<br>
<br>Chorus
<br>The magic way
<br>That boys don't have
<br>The kiss that takes you away
<br>What boys don't have
<br>This is something that I'm sure about
<br>What boys don't have
<br>
<br>2.
<br>Turn it around, make a u-turn Billy
<br>We gotta fly tonight
<br>And leave these lonely roads alone for once
<br>You boys drive on without me and play them tunes
<br>You know it's out of sight
<br>But we all know there's more to life
<br>
<br>Bridge / Chorus
