<br>CHORUS
<br>(CHANT)
<br>Which is the switch and which is the trigger
<br>Which is the switch and which is the trigger...
<br>
<br>VERSE
<br>Who made him go crazy this time--
<br>Who set the landslide off, who sent the demons flying?
<br>Who went and said the magic word--
<br>Who gave the secret sign that nobody else heard?
<br>
<br>Just as sudden as a tornado on a summer's day--
<br>So little warning when it strikes
<br>Just as quickly it might burn right out and fade away.
<br>And leave you shivering in the cold dark night.
