<br>VERSE
<br>What am I thinking getting lost in your gaze?
<br>I should have been in Philly by now.
<br>I don't know who you are but I know I'm pretty far
<br>From the place where I know where I am.
<br>
<br>Laugh that way again, I will count to ten
<br>And see if your soul disappears.
<br>When you think of who you are, do you think you're a star
<br>Or a girl with little dreams and big fears?
<br>
<br>CHORUS
<br>God tell me--
<br>Am I crossing that line--
<br>Will I wake up to find--
<br>I've left it behind--
<br>My right mind...
