<br>
<br>AIN'T SO MUCH
<br>
<br>(1)
<br>It ain't so much that I'm lonely
<br>And it ain't so much that I can't find my way through one more day
<br>So much I want to tell you only
<br>I need some strength and I just can't find my way.
<br>
<br>(2) 
<br>There ain't so much as a grain of sand
<br>That I haven't sifted through my mind since you went away
<br>So much for holding love in my hand
<br>It slipped through my fingers when I needed it so much to stay.
<br>
<br>BRIDGE / CHORUS:
<br>And there's love all around me
<br>Falling from the trees
<br>Like raindrops on the ground
<br>But I can't feel a thing 
<br>I just stare and I don't make a sound.
<br>
<br>It ain't so much that I'm lonely
<br>Ain't so much...
<br>
<br>(3)
<br>There ain't no such thing as a true love
<br>And. there ain't no pretty ship of dreams about to set sail
<br>No good to keep believing
<br>It's only the chapters in a long sad fairy tale.
<br>
<br>(4)
<br>I ain't so far from believing
<br>That you never touched me softly in the long cool night
<br>So much for tender feelings
<br>When all's said and done, it's just another feeling to fight
<br>
