<br>VERSE
<br>In the whirlwind years it's hard enough when you're walking on solid ground
<br>Without some high-five hell on wheels rolling your dreams around.
<br>In the race for whatever passes for apple pie in the sky
<br>She'll always be the winner 'cause she just loves to fly.
<br>
<br>CHORUS
<br>Skate-Punk Groupie--
<br>Not quite loving life,
<br>Curbside, nobody's wife.
<br>
<br>Star-child-to-be--
<br>A star in the eyes
<br>of the boy who leaps the highest.
<br>(alt.: of the universal mind)
