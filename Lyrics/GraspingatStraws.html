<br>Grasping at Straws
<br>
<br>1.
<br>You reach a point 
<br>where you finally see
<br>what really is or isn't gonna be
<br>
<br>Thought you had time 
<br>to make up your mind
<br>but the race is over, you're way behind
<br>
<br>Lash out in the endless dark
<br>You were planning to win 
<br>but you missed your mark
<br>
<br>The cold 
<br>The rain 
<br>You missed the last train
<br>
<br>Chorus
<br>Grasping at straws
<br>Grasp with your sharpest claws
<br>Grasping at straws
<br>
