<br>LIKE I OWNED IT
<br>I opened up a road map, put my finger to a place
<br>like I owned it
<br>Out on the highway thumbed down the first diesel
<br>like I owned it
<br>Sky was black and the stars above
<br>I laid down my head and dreamed of love
<br>When the time came to get up and wander further
<br>I dug my heels into the rich dark earth
<br>like I owned it...
<br>I blew into town 'bout a quarter past five
<br>like I owned it
<br>Threw down my aces, let them know I'd arrived
<br>like I owned it
<br>Yeah I was young and pretty and lean
<br>But the world was old and crusty and mean
<br>I never even stopped to buckle my belt
<br>I swear for all the world it felt
<br>like I owned it...
<br>They gave me a shack and a field of clay
<br>and said I owned it
<br>To plow it and plant it the old-fashioned way
<br>'cause now I owned it
<br>They took my aces and gave me back some threes
<br>Lord what I'd give to feel that breeze
<br>That used to blow me anywhere at all
<br>Anywhere in the world
<br>back when I owned it...
